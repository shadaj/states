This project is created to help me (and other 5th graders) in studying state names, capitals, and abbreviations.

It also helps me practice a new computer programming language I am learning: Scala.

Currently, I am able to run it through IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin, but I hope to provide a simpler way.
